# Learning Machine Learning

Code I wrote while learning machine learning

SVM-CartPole.py uses an svm model to solve the CartPole challenge on OpenAIGym

NN-BipedalWalker.py uses a neural network with genetic optimisation to complete the BipdelWalker challenge on OpenAIGym

NN-LunarLander.py uses a neural network with genetic optimisation to complete the LunarLander challenge on OpenAIGym

TensorFlow-MNIST.py is an implementation of a tensorflow neural network to classify the MNIST dataset

genetic_weights.py is a class used for genetic optimisation of neural networks

neuralnet_v2.py is a class used for implementing neural networks

Naive_Bayes_GaussianNB.py is an implementation of the naive bayes algorithm using skicit-learn
